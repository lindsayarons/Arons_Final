			<h2> What Contributes to Winning for Syracuse Basketball </h2>
			<h4> If it's not attendance, what is it? <br>By Lindsay Arons </h4>

			<h3>Does high fan attendance at sporting events lead to a high win percentage for that team?</h3>
			<p>While many would think high fan attendance leads to high win percentage for sports teams, it surprisingly does not for Syracuse Men’s Basketball. After compiling data from 1980, the year the JMA Wireless Dome (formerly the Carrier Dome) was built, through the 2020-21 season, there is not a strong correlation between attendance and win percentage.

			<h3>If attendance did not contribute to Syracuse's success, what did?</h3>

			<p>Syracuse was a part of the Big East Conference from its inception in 1979 through 2013. The same year the Big East was born marked the debut of ESPN, the nation’s first network devoted to 24-hour sports programming. Rob Lawin ‘77, a former sports editor of the Daily Orange and sports writer for the Syracuse Post-Standard, says the national exposure from ESPN broadcasts helped Big East schools attract many of  the nation’s best high school recruits, such as Patrick Ewing (Georgetown), Chris Mullin (St. John’s) and the Orange’s Pearl Washington.</p>

			<p>“Washington was a transformational recruit,” said Lawin, “the most talented player Syracuse had ever signed.” </p>

			<p>The “ESPN Effect,” as Lawin calls it, is evidenced in the Syracuse team that reached the 1987 NCAA title game. Only two of that squad’s top six players were from the Central New York area – forward Howard Triche was from Syracuse while guard Greg Monroe was from Rochester. </p>

			<p>Other players on that team did not live close in proximity to Syracuse. Forward Derrick Coleman, who would go on to become the first player selected in the 1990 NBA draft, was from Detroit. Guard Sherman Douglas was from Washington D.C. The sixth man, Stevie Thompson was from Los Angeles. Rony Seikaly, the center, was from Athens, Greece. 
 </p>

			<p>“So of the top six players you had people from Greece, Detroit, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles,” says Lawin. “The reach of ESPN’s broadcasts is what helped Syracuse and all Big East teams. This guy from Athens, Greece knew about Syracuse because Big East games  were actually being broadcast in Europe.” 
</p>

			<p>At a point in time where social media was non-existent, these television broadcasts were the main way people were able to watch college basketball games. Being a part of the Big East Conference gave Syracuse the ability to promote its program on a national – and even an international – stage. Catching the eye of recruits gave Big East teams a leg up in getting the world’s best scholastic basketball players.

			<h3>Does attendance affect the win percentage for other sports teams?</h3>
			<p>“Fan attendance has a positive effect on wins,” says <a href="https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1412&context=parkplace/" target="_blank"> Jason Kotecki, </a> who was a Sports Information Assistant at Illinois Wesleyan University in 2014. “Crowd size was positively related to home advantage.” This was Kotecki’s hypothesis prior to conducting an experiment to test if fan attendance and win percentage correlate. </p>
			<p>Kotecki researched possible reasons for this and what goes into home-court advantages, specifically in the NBA.</p>
			<p>One potential reason was referee bias. “Referee biases can be explained through psychological theory that people want to be liked and confirmed in their judgements,” says Kotecki. “Referees do not like to be booed, and therefore will base some of their decisions on crowd reaction. If the home crowd is loud and boisterous, the referee is more likely to not call a foul or infraction on the home team. But, in the same situation, the referee is more likely to call a foul on the away team and receive cheers from the home crowd.” </p>
			<p>“Referee biases could lead teams to change the way they play,” says Kotecki. “If they know there is a referee bias, home teams could be more likely to attack the basket on offense and try to draw fouls. They would take more chances on offense driving to the basket because they know the referee is more than likely to call the foul on the opposing team. On the defensive side of the ball, teams could be more aggressive because they know that referees would be less willing to call a foul.” </p>
			<p>While referee bias is proven to affect win percentage, this can vary depending on what team the home team is facing. </p>
			<p>“When good teams come into town, the home attendance increases, but the winning percentage decreases” says Kotecki. "Although attendance is high and should create a home court advantage, the probability of a win actually decreases.” </p>
			<p>After completing the study, Kotecki came to the conclusion that “the attendance variable is not significant, the fans still have an impact on the game through referee biases.” </p>
			<p>Syracuse basketball saw a sharp decrease in attendance during the 2020-21 season, when no in-game spectators were allowed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is a situation where no fans were allowed, which could be a limitation since an empty stadium may not have the same effect as low attendance. Yet they had one of their more successful seasons. So while many assume attendance affects win percentage, it is not always the case.
